#"iterate" refers to the process of repeating a specific set of operations for each item within a collection or sequence# in Python, such as iterating through a list or a string.
Names = ["Annex","Annie","Annet"]

# for name in Names :
    # print(name)

# Fruits = ["Apple","Banana","Cherry"]
# for fruit in Fruits:
#     print(fruit)
#for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence.
friends = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
# for friend in friends:
#     print("Happy new year",list (friends) [0])

i = 0
while i < len(friends):
 if len(friends[i]) >3:

    print("Happy new year", friends[i])
i += 1
